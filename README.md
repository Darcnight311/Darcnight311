Hey all I'm Borg, not sure what to write ^^
I'm 13 and in general just trying to learn as much as possible in a varity of areas like software developement or web developement.
Although I love webdev my true passions lie within cybersecurity and the protection of mine and others data.
Though it'll be at least 5 years till im there I'm keeping my options open for my older teen years of jobs and internships ^^
